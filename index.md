## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2 part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs as it helped form a comfortable understanding of how to use strings. Having the program ask you to enter a single noun was exciting as we learned to make our program inquire the user with questions. Also understanding where the input and what the expected output should be drastically made the lab easier in understanding fundamentals of strings. 

* Lab 5 part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs as it helped us understand how to use the correct operations to show arithmetic operations. By making us calculate the area of a square or rectangle we were able to learn the correct formatting to use to find the value. By learning this new skill I am able to apply this to future projects if I ever needed to find an area or compute numbers together. 

* Lab 8 part 1

    This was my favorite lab as this program involved writing a function that computes the average mean of all elements of a vector except the minimum and the maximum. Making us think in creative ways in order to accomplish the end task. Computing an array of numbers and finding the mean proved to be more challenging. It made me think of ways to add the sum and divide by the total number of elements.
